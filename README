Basic CoAP library for arduino.
Communication uses WiFiUDP but can easily be changed to any packed based transport.

***************************
* This branch is working as an implementation of the June 2014 version of the CoAP protocol.
* Implements OBSERVE IETF draft (16): https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe
* Block transfer not implemented
*
* Current code has been tested and working on Arduino Mega 2560
*
* Tested against Node-RED v0.10.6 with the node-red-contrib-coap package
*
* Tested functionality:
* GET coap://192.168.0.10/.well-known/core, text/plain
* GET coap://192.168.0.10/light, text/plain
* GET coap://192.168.0.10/button, text/plain, OBSERVE
* POST coap://192.168.0.10/led, text/plain
*
* Not fully tested
   - everything else, e.g. uri queries
* Current TODO list:
   - Make retransmit and observe arrays of vector type
   - Reduce code size
   - Implement random factor for retransmit interval
